## ðŸ”§ Contributing ðŸ’¾
In order to contribute, please respect the following. PR's directly to main will be closed without merge.

Fork from main, and PR to a branch with the %Trunk pattern, preferably PrimaryTrunk. Do not email requesting PR's be accepted.

If you generate any new type of files or folder trees that are not intended for the repo itself, but rather your own local build, consider updating the `.gitignore`.

##### Assets Folder
Please do not remove the "`assets/`" directory location from the `.gitignore` if you wish to contribute. 
Please re-zip your sub-folders into a assets.zip if any changes are made that are intended to for the PR. Do not zip the assets folder itself to allow for easier extracting and less brokent links.
The assets folder is not meant for scenes `(.tscn)` or script `(.cs)` files.

##### Asset Attributions
Please update and or create any necessary attributions files if any additional resources are downloaded, instead of created by hand.
